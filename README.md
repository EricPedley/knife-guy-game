## Description
  Made for Miz Jam 2020 using the Godot game engine. The game centers around controlling a magic knife that can fly between where you point your crosshair and back to your hand, and the purpose is to kill all the enemies on the map, who respond to the force of the knife when they die to go flying and spinning away and make it pretty satsfying to play.
